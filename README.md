**Gamified Productivity App**  
*Personal Project*  
- Developed a fantasy-themed productivity app using **React Router** for seamless navigation and **Redux** for centralized state management.  
- Built three core features: **Notes** (scrolls), **Todos** (quests with sub-tasks), and **Pomodoro Timer**, with **local storage persistence** via Redux middleware for offline access.  
- Optimized performance for large datasets (e.g., thousands of notes) using **React Window** to ensure smooth scrolling and minimal render lag.  
- Integrated **Tailwind CSS** for responsive, modern UI design and consistent theming.  
- Added an **AI-powered summarization feature** to distill user input into concise insights.  
- Designed a **journals page** with a progression system (level/XP visualization), laying groundwork for future gamification.
